## 🚀 About Me

I'm Humphrey Diaz, an Instructor II at Binalatongan Community College and a developer who builds practical, impact-driven systems for education, governance, and community use.

My work sits at the intersection of **education**, **software development**, and **public service**. I design and develop systems not just to fulfill academic requirements, but to solve real institutional and community problems — from student performance monitoring to digital citizen services.

---

## 💻 What I Do

- ✅ Develop **web-based systems** using PHP, SQL, JavaScript, and modern admin templates (AdminLTE, Bootstrap)
- ✅ Build **offline-ready and locally hosted solutions** (WAMP/XAMPP) for schools and LGUs
- ✅ Design **student and faculty information systems**, attendance tracking, and assessment tools
- ✅ Prototype **civic-tech and sustainability apps**, including waste management and public service guidance platforms
- ✅ Integrate **hardware + software concepts** through Arduino and IoT-based ideas

## 🎓 Academic & Professional Focus

- 📚 **Instructor** in Information Technology and related electives
- 🔬 Strong interest in **STEAM**, **digital transformation**, and **data-informed decision making**
- 🌱 Research and development contributor for projects aligned with **SDGs**, **WURI Rankings**, and community innovation
- 💡 Advocate of **technology with purpose** — systems should be usable, sustainable, and meaningful

## 🧠 Development Philosophy

> **"Build systems people can actually use — even with limited resources."**

### I value:

- **Clarity** over complexity
- **Accessibility** for all users
- **Sustainability** in design and deployment
- **Real-world impact** over theoretical features
- **Local-first solutions** that work without constant internet connectivity
